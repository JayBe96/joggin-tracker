## Introduction
This repository contains a mock-up web application called Jogging Tracker, created to demonstrate testing capabilities using various frameworks.

The project is organized into branches that highlight the use of different frameworks:

Cypress Branch: Focused on end-to-end testing with Cypress.

WDIO Branch: Focused on end-to-end testing with WebdriverIO.

---

## Features

- Features of the Webapp:
    - Track jogging sessions with duration, distance, and rating.
    - Log meditation sessions with type, duration, and rating.
    - has a Authentification and a database server.
    - View and edit logged data.
    - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

For the database and authentification Server json-Server was used.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular, Ionic Framework
- **Backend**: JSON Server (for mock data)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for Android/iOS builds
- **Other Tools**: RxJS, SCSS, TypeScript

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI installed globally
- Ionic CLI installed globally

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/joggin-tracker.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd joggin-tracker
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
4. Start the application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
5. start the authentification mock JSON server:
     ```bash
     npm run start:auth
     ```
6. start database mock JSON server:
     ```bash
     npm run start:db
     ```
7. if it didn't open by itself open a browser with:
     ```bash
     http://localhost:4200/login
     ```
