### My Reply 
```
Okay it is installed what next?
```
### Step 2: Open Cypress for the First Time
Run the following command in your project's root directory to open Cypress and generate the necessary folder structure:  
```
npx cypress open
```
#### Explanation
- **Purpose**: This command launches the Cypress Test Runner for the first time.
- **Reasoning**: Running npx cypress open initializes Cypress by creating the default cypress/ directory structure and example tests. This setup provides a foundation for organizing your tests and understanding Cypress's capabilities.
- **Outcome**: After running the command, you'll see the Cypress Test Runner window. You can close it once the setup is complete.
#### What Happens Next
- **Folder Structure**: Cypress creates a cypress/ folder with subdirectories like fixtures/, integration/, plugins/, and support/. These directories help organize your test files, test data, plugins, and support utilities.
- **Example Tests**: Cypress includes example test files in the integration/ directory. These examples demonstrate how to write tests and can be used as references.
- **Configuration File**: A cypress.config.js file is created in your project's root directory. This file allows you to customize Cypress settings as needed.

### Step 1: Configure Cypress

1. **Open the Cypress Configuration File**

   Locate and open `cypress.config.js` in your project root directory.

2. **Set the Base URL**

   Update the `baseUrl` to point to your application's local development server.

   ```javascript
   // filepath: /c:/Users/jonas/Documents/GitHub/Bachelorthesis/joggin-tracker/cypress.config.js
   const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

   module.exports = defineConfig({
     e2e: {
       baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4200',
       setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
         // implement node event listeners here
       },
     },
   })

### Step 2: Create Your First Test
1. **Navigate to the E2E Tests Directory**  
Go to 2-advanced-examples.
2. **Create a New Test File**  
Create a file named first_test.cy.js.
3. **Add Test Code**  
Insert the following code into first_test.cy.js to set up a basic test.
```javascript
// filepath: /c:/Users/jonas/Documents/GitHub/Bachelorthesis/joggin-tracker/cypress/e2e/2-advanced-examples/first_test.cy.js
describe('First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the app root url', () => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.contains('Welcome')
  })
})
```
### Step 3:  Run Your Test
1. **Open Cypress Test Runner**  
```
npx cypress open
```
2. **Select the Test File**  
In the Cypress Test Runner, click on first_test.cy.js to run your test.
